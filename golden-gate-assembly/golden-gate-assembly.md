## Golden Gate Assembly  

### Objective  
Insert the part, BBa_F2620, into the pET-HIS6-TEV backbone.  

### Steps:
1. Import the pET-HIS6-TEV and BBa_F2620 Genbank files (.gb) into Benchling.  
2. Create a new assembly by clicking on the 'ASSEMBLY WIZARD' (bottom horizontal toolbar)  
3. Select a 'Golden Gate' assembly and title 'pET-BBa_F2620'  
4. Set the backbone from the pET-HIS6-TEV plasmid, Benchling should automatically detect the BsaI cut sites  
    a) Select the backbone by changing cut site selection to encompass plasmid
    b) Set Fragment  
5. Navigate to the BBa_F2620 part, select insert by using the automatically detected BsaI cut sites --> Set Fragment  
6. Assemble
